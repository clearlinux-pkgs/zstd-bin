Zstandard, or zstd as short version, is a fast lossless compression algorithm,
targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression
ratios. It's backed by a very fast entropy stage, provided by Huff0 and FSE
library. The project is provided as an open-source dual BSD and GPLv2 licensed
C library, and a command line utility producing and decoding .zst, .gz, .xz and
.lz4 files.
